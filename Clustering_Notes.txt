Clustering Algorithms

Central to all of the goals of cluster analysis is the notion of the degree of similarity (or dissimilarity) between the individual objects being clustered. 
A clustering method attempts to group the objects based on the definition of similarity supplied to it.

A list of 10 of the more popular algorithms is as follows:

  Affinity Propagation
  Agglomerative Clustering
  BIRCH
  DBSCAN
  K-Means
  Mini-Batch K-Means
  Mean Shift
  OPTICS
  Spectral Clustering
  Mixture of Gaussians
